    <h2>Testimony to Madagascar</h2>
    <p>
      Our broodstocks are directly imported from Madagascar. Madagascar being an
      isolated geography, far from other shrimp-farming countries, it is
      disease-free. And the producers put in significant efforts to promote
      quality over quantity to preserve the pristine characteristics of
      Madagascar. And so all partners involved are fully convinced that the only
      sustainable, long-term approach must be based on the maintenance of
      environmental integrity and total exclusion of foreign shrimp species and
      pathogens (SPF) complying all the sanitary norms.
